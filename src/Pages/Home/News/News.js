                            <p className="card-text">Trip cancellation insurance, sometimes known as trip interruption insurance or trip delay insurance, reimburses a traveler for prepaid, nonrefundable travel expenses. Providers vary on acceptable cancellation and interruption causes and the amount of reimbursement available. The most common acceptable reasons include illness, a death in the immediate family, sudden business conflicts, and weather-related issues.

                                Trip cancellation is beneficial when paying more upfront than what you're comfortable losing. For example, if you pay $2,000 for a package tour and the tour's cancellation policy stipulates that all but $100 is refundable upon cancellation, travel insurance will cover only the nonrefundable $100. Also, there is no need to protect a refundable airline ticket. </p>

                            <p className="card-text">There are so many nice places on the earth. They are scattered across the country. Every place has its own distinct features. Some places have scenic beauty in abundance while many are famous for their architectural wonders. In addition every person has different tastes, choices and likings. Several people enjoy the sight of scenic beauty; some are attracted towards places of historical and archaeological interests. A few may be interested in visiting places of religious importance.I have visited so many places of historical and tourist interest. But the visit which has a lasting impression on my mind is the visit of Kashmir. It is the most beautiful place I have ever seen. It is said to be the heaven on earth. It has the accolade of being “The Switzerland of India”. I was wonderstruck to see the ravishing beauty of Kashmir. With snow-clad mountains, tall-trees of Chinar, lush green plains and valleys, Kashmir is one of the most bewitching places on earth. It has been a great attraction for the tourists all across the country and abroad as well.</p>
